# Basic Integer Stack CLI 

A quick rust CLI for mainting a stack. Contains push and pop commands. To use, simply run a quick cargo run (or just the exe). To add numbers, run 

```
push [num]
```

To pop the top n elements off the stack, run 

```
pop [n]
```

Add the optional backwards flag to pop the bottom n elements off the stack. 

To push multiple elements at once to the stack, run 

```
push-multiple [n] [m] ...
```


To exit, run a keyboard interrupt with ctrl + c.
